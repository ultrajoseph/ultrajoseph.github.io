# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

#
# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

user_intro: '[Amidst the wild expanse, Sean, a cowboy silhouette against the rugged backdrop, channels the reflective vibe of Matthew McConaughey.]
Sean: Ava, shes like that aged cheese from the shores of Wisconsin, ya know? Layers of depth, complexities, and a flavor that lingers, much like the stories of the range. She aint just my partner; shes the taste of exploration woven into every adventure we saddle up for.
[Taking a moment to soak in the endless vista, he continues.]
Sean: Avas akin to a fine cheese, Patagonias skies—each moment with her, an unwrapping of new flavors, a richness akin to the untouched wilderness.
[Lost in reverie, a smile grazes Seans face.]
Sean: Being with her is like savoring the most exquisite cheese. Every trail ridden, every whispered dream shared, its a taste that lingers, leaving me craving more of this remarkable journey.
[Gazing out at the untamed terrain, a wistful air envelops Sean.]
Sean: Avas more than my travel partner; shes my blend of adventure and comfort, just like a fine cheese board under the stars. Shes... shes like the horizon I ride towards, a mix of adventure and familiarity etched into the map of our exploration.
[As the camera captures the raw beauty of the landscape, Sean remains, encapsulated in the essence of Ava, a cherished memory amidst the grandeur of their adventures, much like the allure of aged cheese in the wild.]
